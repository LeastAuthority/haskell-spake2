=============================
Haskell SPAKE2 implementation
=============================

Implementation of SPAKE2 key exchange protocol.

Status
======

Doesn't actually work.
We are in the middle of implementing it.

Goals
=====

* compatibility with `python-spake2 <https://github.com/warner/python-spake2>`_
* (stretch) submit to `cryptonite <https://github.com/haskell-crypto/cryptonite>`_

Non-goals
=========

Right now:

* PAKE2+
* any `Elligator Edition <https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2015/000424.html>`_ variants

Contributing
============

We use `stack <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/>`_ for building and testing.

High-quality documentation with examples is very strongly encouraged,
because this stuff is pretty hard to figure out, and we need all the help we can get.
